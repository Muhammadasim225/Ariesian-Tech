# 🎧 Music Player App 🎧

This is a **ReactJS** based music player app developed as part of my internship at **Ariesian Tech**. The app allows users to play/pause music, navigate through a playlist, and experience a seamless, responsive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Play/Pause functionality**: Control your music with easy-to-use buttons.
- **State synchronization**: Ensures that all components stay updated with the current play state.
- **Dynamic song display**: Shows the current song being played.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **HTML5CSS3**: For structuring and styling the app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid styling and a responsive design.
